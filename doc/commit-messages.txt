* Commit messages must consist of a short title and an informational text after that
* The title should not be longer than 50 characters
* PLEASE wrap the text lines at 72 characters or so
* vim does commit message formatting AUTOMATICALLY

Example message:
<snip>
Change gizmo to fiddle instead of twiddling

Twiddling is considered bad practice and fiddling should be done
instead. Make gizmo::gimmick() count to three.
</snip>

Messages do not need to be long, but do write something more detailed than what just the title says.

What the commit does is obvious to its writer and by looking at the code it's trivial to see what changes to the code it does. Write the message so that other people will easily grasp what the change is, and, if possible, WHY it is there.
