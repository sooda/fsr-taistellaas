Read the documentation before coding, in this order:
	git-workflow.txt
	commit-messages.txt
	git.txt (read only brifly and memorize that it includes googlable magic words)
	programming-guidelines.txt

If you have the time, look into:
	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html
	http://git-scm.com/documentation
	http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/

If feeling like a pro, read:
	git-prompt.txt

BUGS:
	- too much git documentation here already, as googling will always help anyway
