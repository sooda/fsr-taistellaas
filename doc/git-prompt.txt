Protip: at some point you'll note that you do "git status" all the time to
- see which branch you are in
- check if you have a dirty tree
- see if you're still bisecting/in a conflict/else

It's possible to put that information to the shell prompt line. Many distributions have git prompt scripts automagically installed somewhere so that it can be used straight away.
