## These are probably the most improtant parameters
##


##
## This file contains many parameters that the particle
## filter uses. Some of these could also have something
## to do with the actual laser scanner? Actual laser
## scanner parameters are defined in the gfs-j2b2.cpp
##

## gfs - number of particles
particles        10

## gfs measurement integration
angularUpdate       0.2
linearUpdate        0.2

## map resolution
delta            0.03

## scan matcher

maxUrange        10.0     #   (use up to)
sigma            0.05     # scan matcher cell sigma, for the greedy search
regscore         0.0004   # minimum score for regsistering a scan 
iterations       2        # iterations 
critscore        0.0      # critical score (leave this)
maxMove          1.0      # maximum move among two scans. This detects some corrupted logs
autosize         off	  # determine te map size by pre readoing the log


## default settings for a 0.1 m map cell
lstep            0.03     # linear search step (choose delta)
astep            0.01      # angular search step, this is fine, depending on the odometry error and the update interval
lsigma           0.05       # sigma likelihood of 1 beam
lskip            0	   # beams to skip in the likelihood computation
skipMatching     off	   # do not perform scan matching before computing the statistics

kernelSize       0.7        # the higher the value the slower the filter
                          # the better it can deal with noise, but the less precise and slower
ogain            3	  # gain for smoothing the likelihood
resampleThreshold   0.5   # when neff  is below this value a resampling occurs
randseed            0	  # this is for the repeated experiments

## likelihood sampling
